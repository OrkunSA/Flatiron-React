# React Controlled Components Lab

## Overview

In this lab, you'll write and use controlled components, and write
validation for form components.

## Controlled Components

Now that we know how to handle form elements in React and how to set up
controlled components, it's time to put that knowledge to the test. This lab is
fairly extensive, but you'll use many core React concepts here that will surface
again and again. Time to get some practice in!

General notes for this lab:

* Most of the DOM is pre-written for you in these exercises. _Please do not remove
anything that is already in the file_ — most of it is necessary to ensure that
the tests run correctly.

* When instructed to save a value in the state, it doesn't matter what key you use, as long as it's in there!

## `TwitterMessage`

1. Open the `components/TwitterMessage.js` file.

2. This component takes one prop: `maxChars` which is a number — the maximum
amount of characters a message can have. This prop is being passed in from the
App component with the value `280`.

3. You'll find an `<input type="text">` in this component. Make this a
controlled component by adding the attributes to the `<input>` element. Its
value should be saved in the component's state and should update on _every_
change to the input.

4. Show the _remaining_ characters in the component. It doesn't matter how you
render it, as long as the number is correct. No need to guard against input that
is too long — you can let the counter reach negative values.

## `LoginForm`

1. Open the `components/LoginForm.js` file.

2. This component takes one prop: `handleLogin` which is a function — this function
is called when the form is being submitted. By default, this function
currently just includes `console.log`. That will allow you to see if the form is
functioning correctly when working in your browser.

3. You'll find two inputs in this component: `<input type="text">` and `<input
type="password">`. Make this a controlled component by adding the necessary
attributes to these inputs. The input values should be saved to the
component's state on every change.

4. An example of an input would look like:

   ```js
   <input
     id="username"
     type="text"
     name="username"
     value={this.state.username}
     onChange={this.handleInputChange}
   />
   ```

5. Remember that you can retrieve the input `name` and `value` of an
`event.target` from the JS event.

6. Add the necessary event handler to the `<form>` element in order to call the `onSubmit` callback prop.

7. The `onSubmit` callback prop should only be called if _both_ fields are
filled in (with any value).

**Note**: In the starter code are `id` attributes - these are used in the
tests, so make sure to leave them as they are.
